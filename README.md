=======
This project is an early-stage implementation of an interactive 4-year planner for students, allowing them to drag and drop classes into a scheduler. The static webpage consists of an index.html file and a style.css file. The interface includes a search bar, blocks holding the names of classes on one side, and a scheduler on the other side.
