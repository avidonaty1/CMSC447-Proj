# CMSC447-Proj: Interactive 4-Year Plan Project

This project is an early-stage implementation of an interactive 4-year planner for students, allowing them to drag and drop classes into a scheduler. The static webpage consists of an index.html file and a style.css file. The interface includes a search bar, blocks holding the names of classes on one side, and a scheduler on the other side.

## Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)

## Running the Webpage

- First clone the git repository by running this command
```sh
git clone https://github.com/avidonaty1/CMSC447-Proj.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd CMSC447-Proj
```

- Open the HTML file: Double-click on index.html or right-click and select Open with to choose your browser.


## Customization

To modify the styling, edit style.css.

Troubleshooting

If the page does not load properly, ensure that the file paths are correct.

Clear the browser cache if style updates are not reflecting.
